# Readme for NarrativeWorldCreator project
This WPF C# application was implemented to be used in the user study of the thesis "Narrative world creation with assisted environment filling" by Marijn Goedegebure. The thesis itself can be found here: https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A819b3f0e-bcac-4501-86aa-f23199fee8e1?collection=education.

Next to this application a GPGPU algorithm was implemented based on the research "Interactive Furniture Layout Using Interior Design Guidelines" and implementation by Paul Merrel et al. The GPGPU algorithm can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/marijngoedegebure/metropolis-hastings-gpgpu/src/master/

If you have any questions regarding the implementation you can contact me at marijngoedegebure @ gmail.com.

This WPF C# application and the GPGPU algorithm are both available to the public under the MIT licence, see below.
