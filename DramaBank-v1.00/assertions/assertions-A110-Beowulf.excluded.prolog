Now is the day come that our liege-lord has need of strength of good war-men; let us go to, aid the battle-leader, while the heat lasts, the fierce fire-terror. God knows of me that to me it is much more agreeable, that my body with my gold-giver the fire embraces; it does not seem proper to me, that we bear shields back to our land, unless we first can fell the foe, defend the life of the chief of the Wederas; I know well, that his deeds of old are not such, that he alone should of the Geats\' retinue sorrow suffer, to sink in strife; for the two of us must sword and helm, byrnie and rich shroud both share.\' Then he waded through the smoke of slaughter, bore his war-head to the support of his lord;').

sourceText(timelineProposition131, 'at the need of the folk-king the nobleman alongside displayed courage, strength and boldness, as was natural to him; he did not heed (the dragon\'s) head, though the hand was burned of the spirited man, there he his strength helped, that he the hostile outsider struck somewhat lower, the warrior in his war-gear, so that the sword sank in gleaming and golden so that the fire began to weaken after that.').
sourceText(timelineProposition132, 'That was for the chieftain the last time of victory by his own deeds, in the world of action.

Then the noble went, so that he by the wall wise in thought sat on a seat; he looked on the giants\' work how the stone-arches on firm pillars the eternal earth-hall supported within.').

Now go you quickly to examine the hoard under the hoary grey stone, dear Wiglaf, now the wyrm lies dead, sleeping sorely wounded, deprived of treasure be now in haste, that I the ancient wealth, the possession of gold might perceive, readily behold sparkling cleverly-cut gems, so that I can the more pleasantly for treasure-wealth leave my life and nation, that long I ruled.\'').

Tend still the need of the nation. I cannot be here longer; order war-famed men to construct a mound bright after the fire, at the ocean\'s cape; it shall to remind my people tower high on headland of whales, so that it sea-farers then will name Beowulf\'s Barrow, those who ships over the seas\' mists drive from afar.\' Took him from his neck the golden ring, the valiant chief, to the thane gave, to the young spear-warrior, gold-adorned helm, ring and byrnie, told him to use them well: \'You are the last remainder of our race, of the Waegmundings; Fate has swept off all of my kinsmen into destined death, earls in their strength; I must go after them.\'').

sourceText(timelineProposition137, 'Wiglaf spoke, Weohstan\'s son, a man sore at heart looked on the unloved men: \'That, indeed, may say he who wishes to speak the truth, that the liege-lord, he who gave you treasures, cavalry-gear, that you stand in there-- when he on the ale-bench often gave to hall-sitters helm and byrnie, the chieftain to his thanes such as he the grandest anywhere far or near was able to find-- that he completely war-clothing grievously threw away, when fighting befell him; not at all the folk-king his companions in arms need to boast about; yet God granted him, victories\' Ruler, that he avenged himself, one with a blade, when for him was need of valour. I him life-protection little could provide in war, and yet began beyond my measure to aid my kinsman; ever was it the weaker when I struck with sword, the deadly enemy, fire less fiercely surged from the seat of intellect; leaders too few thronged around the chieftain, when distress came to him. How must treasure-receipt and sword-giving all native joy for your kin, delight cease! Of land-rights must of your clan every man become deprived, when nobles from afar learn of your flight, gloryless dead: death is better for all men than a life of dishonour.\'').

sourceText(timelineProposition139, 'For me haste is best, that we the people-king look upon there, and that one bring, he who gave us rings, on a journey to the pyre; nor must a part only melt with that great-spirited one, but there is the treasure\'s hoard, gold uncounted, bitterly purchased, and now at last with his own life bought the rings: then the blaze must devour, the fire cover, no man shall wear these treasures in remembrance, no pretty girl shall have on her neck ring-adornment, but must, sad-hearted, bereft of gold, often, not once, tread in alien land, now the cohort-leader has laid aside laughter pleasure and merriment. Therefore must be spears many, morning-cold, grasped in palms, raised in hands, not at all the sound of harp to wake the warrior, but the black raven, eager over the doomed, speaking many things, telling the eagle, how he succeeded in eating, when he with the wolf despoiled the slain.\' So the bold men was teller of hateful tidings; he did not lie much in deeds or in words.').
sourceText(timelineProposition140, 'Wiglaf spoke, the son of Weohstan, \'Often must many men, for the will of one, endure exile, as it has happened to us; we could not convince the beloved prince, the keeper of the kingdom, by any counsel, that he not greet the gold-ward, let him lie, where he long had been, inhabiting his abodes until the world\'s end; he held to his noble destiny; the hoard is exposed, grimly gained; that was granted too harshly which him impelled thither. I was there inside and looked over all of it, the trappings of the hall, when the way was cleared for me, not at all sweetly was the errand allowed inside the earthwall; I seized in haste much with my hands, a mighty burden of hoard-treasures, bore it out hither to my king; he was still alive then, wise and knowing; he spoke much on many things, old in his grief, and commanded me greet you all, bid that you build in accord of your friend\'s deeds in the cremation place a high barrow, large and splendid, as he was of men a warrior most honoured thought this wide earth, while he the prosperity of a city could enjoy. Let us now hasten another time to see and to seek in that heap of cunningly wrought things, a wonder under the walls; I shall guide you, so that you sufficient close-up will see rings and broad gold; let the bier be ready, quickly prepared, when we come out, and then carry our lord, beloved man, where he must long in the Ruler\'s protection endure.\'').

Then for him prepared the people of the Geats a pyre on the earth, not trifling, hung with helmets, with battle-shields, with bright byrnies, as he had requested; they laid then in the midst the famed chieftain, the lamenting heroes, their belov?d lord; then began on the barrow the greatest bale-fire, the warriors to kindle; wood-smoke arose, swarthy over the heat, the roaring flame woven with weeping --the tumult of winds lay still-- until it the bone-house had broken hot at heart;').
sourceText(timelineProposition143, 'so too a death-dirge a solitary Geatish woman wove for Beowulf, cruelly bound, she sang sorrowful, earnestly of fortune that she for herself days of harm fiercely dreaded, of multitude of slaughter-feasts, terror of troops, rapine and bondage.').
sourceText(timelineProposition144, 'then wrought the Wederas\' people a barrow on the hill, it was high and broad, for wave-farers widely visible, and they constructed in ten days the war-chief\'s beacon, the leavings of the fire, with a wall they encircled, as it most worthily the very wisest men could devise; they placed in the barrow rings and brooches, all such trappings, as before from the hoard hostile men had taken away; the treasure of heroes they let the earth hold, gold in the gritty soil, where it now still lives, as useless to men as it was before. Then around the mound rode the battle-brave sons of nobles, twelve in all, they wished to bewail their sorrow, to mourn their king, to pronounce elegy, and speak about the man; they praised his heroic deeds and his works of courage, exalted his majesty. As it is fitting, that one his friend and lord honours in words, cherish in one\'s spirit, when he must forth from his body be led; thus bemourned the people of the Geats their lord\'s fall, his hearth-companions: they said that he was, of all kings of the world, the most generous of men, and the most gracious, the most protective of his people, and the most eager for honour.').
